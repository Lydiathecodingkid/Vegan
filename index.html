<div class="transbox">
Crust: <br>
1. Preheat oven to 350*. Pulse oats, whole wheat flour, coconut oil, agave, cocoa, salt, and cinnamon in a food processor until oats are coarsely ground and mixture looks like wet sand. <br>
2. Firmly press into bottom and up the sides of tart pan. Bake until crust is golden brown and smells toasty, 20-25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack; let cool. <br>
Filling: <br>
1. Dissolve espresso powder in 3/4 cup very hot water in a food processor. Add cocoa and let sit 5 minutes. Add melted chocolate, agave syrup, vanilla, 2/3 cup coconut oil, and 1/4 tsp. kosher salt and process until mixture is very smooth and thick, about 30 seconds. <br>
2. Scrape filling into cooled tart shell and smooth top (if making tart in a rectangular shell, you may have a little filling left over; save for another use, like truffles). Tap tart lightly against counter to pop any air bubbles in filling. <br>
3. Cook oats and remaining 1 tsp. coconut oil in a small skillet over low heat, stirring constantly, until oats are toasted, about 3 minutes. Gradually add half of demerara sugar, stirring constantly, until sugar is melted, then remove from heat and stir in remaining demerara sugar just to coat. Season with kosher salt; let oat mixture cool. <br>
4. Scatter oat mixture over tart, sprinkle with sea salt, and chill until filling is set, at least 1 hour. <br>
5. Cut chilled tart into slices with a dry, hot knife; let sit at room temperature 15-20 minutes before serving.
